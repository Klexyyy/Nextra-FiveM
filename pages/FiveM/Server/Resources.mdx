# Starting Resources

To ensure your server loads resources automatically when it starts, you need to configure your `server.cfg` file.

## Adding Resources to `server.cfg`

1. **Open your `server.cfg` file** using a text editor (e.g., Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code).
2. **Use the `ensure` command** to load individual resources. Example:

```plaintext
# Ensuring individual resources
ensure resource1
ensure resource2
```

### Using ensure for Resource Folders
Instead of adding each resource individually, you can load all resources from a folder by using square brackets []:

```plaintext
# Ensuring all resources in a folder
ensure [resourcefolder1]
ensure [resourcefolder2]
```
All resources within the specified folders will be automatically loaded when the server starts, making your configuration simpler and more efficient.
