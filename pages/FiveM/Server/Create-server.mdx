### Installation

- Open the `server.zip` file. If you can't find the download, open the downloads using `Ctrl + J`.
- Create a new folder on your `C:/` drive. Call it `FiveM` and in that folder create a new folder called `FXServer`.
- Go back to the `server.zip` file, copy all the content and paste it in your `FXServer` folder
- Once you've put all the content in the `FXServer` folder, scroll down and find `FXServer.exe`, double click it.

### txAdmin

- On the first setup of the server, txAdmin automatically opens in the browser.
- In the console that just opened after starting `FXserver.exe` you will find a pin consisting of 4 digits. This pin is automatically filled in in txAdmin.
- Click <LinkButton text={"Link Account"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/53Zl2ctKexiN.png"}/>
- If you do not have one, create a Cfx.re account, if you have one, click <LinkButton text={"Continue"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/OejE3TvrupOI.png"}/>
- Now you should see <LinkButton text={"the following"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/vhQmHPlunx77.png"}/>, create a password, confirm it 1 more time, accept the "Creator PLA" and click "Register"

- On the "Active servers" section you will find your newly created Keymaster license key. Click the ID and click "Copy" right next to the blurred key.
