# Winrar notice

If you see this page, it likely means that you started your server from the Winrar file.
This is something that you are not supposed to do. It will not save any of your progress.
As soon as you close the server, it will just keep asking to create a new one.

### What to Do:  

Close the server and start over again but this time make sure to follow [this guide](https://docs.yorick.gg/FiveM/Server/Create-server) to learn how to setup your FiveM server the proper way.
