# Documentation
 
This documentation website is meant to provide useful guides for your FiveM server!

## Introduction of things you will find on this website

In this guide you will find all sorts of information regarding ownership of a FiveM server but you can also find some general information whether that's FiveM related or not.

<Callout type="warning">
Note: this guide specifically aims for Windows at this moment. Maybe in the future I will add Linux as well.
