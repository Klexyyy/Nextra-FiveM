# Screenshot Reminder

If you see this page, it likely means you sent a screenshot that lacked important information.  

### What to Do:  
Please send a **full screenshot** that clearly shows all relevant details, and I will be able to assist you further.

No idea what I mean by "full screenshot"?   <LinkButton text={"Click here"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/kEvUo6ggJgFN.png"}/>

As you can see, this screenshot includes all information that is visible on my screen from corner to corner.

Thank you!
