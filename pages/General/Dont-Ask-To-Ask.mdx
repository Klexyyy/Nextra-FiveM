# Don't Ask to Ask - Just Ask!

Welcome to the FiveM community! If you need help, feel free to **ask your question directly**. There's no need to ask things like, "Can I ask a question?" or "Can I get help with this script? or "Any people around with qbox knowledge?"

## Why?

- **Saves time** - No one likes it when people waste time for no reason.
- **Gets noticed quicker** - Most people would not even look at an "Ask to ask" question.
- **Keeps things efficient** - It's easier for everyone to help.

## How to Ask

1. **Be clear** - Describe the issue you're facing in detail.
2. **Be specific** - Mention the script, error, or situation you're dealing with.
3. **Be respectful** - We're here to help, so be polite and patient.

### Examples

**Don't:**  
- "Can someone help me with a script?"
- "Is anyone online to answer a question?"

**Do:**  
- "I'm trying to get a script working that spawns vehicles, but it's throwing this error: `nil value`. I've tried checking the config but can't figure it out. Any ideas?"

### Important note

<Callout>
When asking for help, always make sure that the screenshots that you provide are fullscreen, if you don't understand what I mean by this, <LinkButton text={"here"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/2X03Q9vVqla1.png"}/> is an example.
<br></br>
*Even if you believe that your screenshot includes enough information for the helper to see, it will most likely not.*
