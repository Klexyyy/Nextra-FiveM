# Master account

In this guide I will be explaining how to change your master account.

The guide consists of the following parts:

- Shutting down server
- Locating the admins file
- Changing the value

## Shutting down the server

<Callout>
The first thing you should always do when making changes to the admin file is making sure that the server is not running at that moment.
</Callout>

<Steps>
1. Close the <LinkButton text={"FXServer.exe"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/e4MQZEzyaQ1t.png"}/> window in your taskbar.
2. There are obviously a few ways to do this, my preferred method is pressing `Ctrl + C`while in the terminal because it's reliable and will kill the process 100% of the times.
3. <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/jbo6lsWrMYtk.png"}/> should be the result of doing that.

## Locating the admins file

- The `admins.json` file is always located inside your `txData` folder.
- It should be <LinkButton text={"here"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/qmqJ3hDqckAv.png"}/>
- Maybe for you it does not say `.json`, this is because I have my file extension names enabled.

## Changing the value
1. Open the file, you should now see something like this:

```js
  {
    "name": "Yorick",
    "master": true,
    "password_hash": "",
    "providers": {
      "citizenfx": {
        "id": "Yorick",
        "identifier": "",
        "data": {
          "name": "Yorick",
          "profile": "",
          "nameid": "",
          "picture": ""
        }
      },
      "discord": {
        "id": "",
        "identifier": "",
        "data": {}
      }
    },
    "permissions": [],
    "$schema": 1
  },
```
2. Where it says `"master": true`, change that to `false` and apply `true` to the user that you want to be the master account.
3. Start the server back up again and see if the change has completed successfully.
