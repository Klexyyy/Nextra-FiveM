In this guide I will be explaining how to configure the Discord bot from txAdmin

## Discord Developer Portal

<Steps>

### Head over to the Developer Portal

- Go to the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers).
- Create a <LinkButton text={"New Application"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/yUY1gY6ciedK.png"} />.
- Enter a name, accept the ToS, and click Create.
- On the General Information page, click OAuth2 on the left.
- Under Scopes, <LinkButton text={"select bot"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/kUimNPQ4CM5l.png"}/>.
- Leave the permissions empty!
- Scroll down, copy the generated URL and open it in a new browser tab.
- Select the Discord server and click Continue.
- The bot/application has now joined your Discord server.
- Go back to the Developer Portal and click Bot.
- Click <LinkButton text={"Reset Token"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/MdqnXvFB9k7w.png"}/> and copy the bot token. You can save this in a notepad for now.
- Ensure <LinkButton text={"Privileged Gateway Intents"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/gb7A4G3Ridzk.png"}/> are enabled.
- You can now close this tab and go back to your txAdmin web panel.

<Callout type="error">
**Never share your Discord bot token with anyone!**
</Callout>

### txAdmin settings

- In txAdmin, head over to "Settings -> Discord".
- You should now be at a page that looks like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/ooX5XCTaak9u.png"}/>.
- Make sure to enable the bot with the switch.
- Copy the Discord token that we kept in the notepad earlier in the "Token" field.
- Enable Discord developer mode: Settings -> Advanced -> Developer mode.
- Go to Discord, right click your Discord server and click "Copy Server ID".
- If you want the bot to send announcements to the Discord, paste the channel ID that you want to use.
- Click "Save Discord Settings".
