In this guide I will be explaining how to add extra admins to your txAdmin.

## Admin manager txAdmin

<Steps>

### Head over to the "Admins" tab in txAdmin

- Open txAdmin in the browser and in the navigation bar at the top, find the option "Admins" <LinkButton text={"see"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/YwAeZc3wJcHe.png"}/>
- This page should look like this <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/ZYLZNUxZcDTo.png"}/>

### Add a new admin

- On that same page is a green button "Add", <LinkButton text={"the following modal"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/tlMhaBc2Bo7F.png"}/> should appear now.
- In the "New Admin" modal, you will have to give the new admin a username, optionally you can add the admin's IDs here. This is not required.
- Now you can set the permissions for this admin.

### Temp password

- Once you have created the admin account you should get a pop up with a temporary password, share this password with your admin.
- When the new admin logs in with this password, the admin immediately gets prompted with <LinkButton text={"an option"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/dZciJXaFz2EH.png"}/> to change the temporary password.
- The new admin account should now be able to login to txAdmin! 

</Steps>
