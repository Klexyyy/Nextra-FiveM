# Update

In this guide I will be explaining how to update your txAdmin

The guide consists of the following parts:

- Shutting down server
- FXServer artifacts
- Replacing files

## Shutting down the server

<Callout>
The first thing you should always do when updating your txAdmin is making sure that the server is not running at that moment.
</Callout>

<Steps>
1. Close the <LinkButton text={"FXServer.exe"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/e4MQZEzyaQ1t.png"}/> window in your taskbar.
2. There are obviously a few ways to do this, my preferred method is pressing `Ctrl + C`while in the terminal because it's reliable and will kill the process 100% of the times.
3. <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/jbo6lsWrMYtk.png"}/> should be the result of doing that.

## FXServer artifacts

1. <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/pub/4wehxrmjdogo.jpg"}/> is what the so called "artifacts" look like.
2. Go to [this website](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) to download the FiveM artifacts.
3. Install the version with the highest number, <LinkButton text={"example"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/0L4U6yaaHVKK.png"}/>.

## Replacing files
1. Once you have installed the artifacts, it should show up in your downloads as "server-X.7z" like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/0KyR9QgD6Ysn.png"}/>.
2. The content should should look like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/b1SfBgSieJfl.png"}/>.
3. Select all of the files in here using `Ctrl + A`, head over to your current artifacts folder and replace it with the files that you just installed.
4. The only thing that is left right now is starting the server again to check if the update has been executed succesfully.
